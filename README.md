# Python Assignment - Module 4: Functions & Modules

## Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

### Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Defines a function named `factorial` that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.
2. Returns the calculated factorial.
3. Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.

### Expected Output:
For example, if the function is called with 5, it should return:
Enter a number:5 The factorial of 5 is: 120

## Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

### Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Asks the user for a number as input.
2. Uses the math module to calculate the:
   - Square root of the number
   - Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
   - Sine of the number (in radians)
3. Displays the calculated results.

### Expected Output:
For example, if the user enters 25, the output should be:
Enter a number: 25 Square root of 25 is: 5.0 Natural log of 25 is: 3.2188758248682006 Sine of 25 radians is: -0.13235175009777303
